## 2. Key Driver Analysis

### Active Membership Impact
![Active Membership vs Churn](https://i.imgur.com/JH2XEbx.png)

This visualization shows the dramatic difference in churn rates between active and inactive members:
- Inactive members: 38.5% churn rate
- Active members: 25.6% churn rate
- Causal effect: 17.5 percentage point reduction in churn probability for active customers

### Balance Distribution by Churn Status
![Balance Distribution by Churn](https://i.imgur.com/dLWRmMR.png)

This density plot reveals how balance distributions differ significantly:
- Churned customers have substantially higher balances
- Mean balance for churned customers: $119,277
- Mean balance for retained customers: $72,832
- IV analysis confirms causal relationship: higher balances increase churn risk

### Products and Churn Relationship

This bar chart demonstrates the protective effect of multiple products:
- Single-product customers: 41.7% churn rate
- Two-product customers: 16.7% churn rate
- Three-product customers: 10.7% churn rate
- Four-product customers: 0% churn rate

### Customer Tenure Effect

This line chart shows how churn probability decreases with tenure:
- Sharp decline in early years
- Significant drop at 5-year milestone (RDD analysis confirms 6.8pp causal reduction)
- Confidence intervals widen with longer tenure due to fewer observations

## 3. Geographic Analysis

### Churn Rate by Country

This map visualization highlights geographic differences:
- France: 36.1% churn rate
- Spain: 27.7% churn rate
- Germany: 26.6% churn rate

### Geographic Differences in Key Metrics

This small multiple visualization shows how key metrics vary by country:
- Balance distributions
- Active membership percentages
- Product holdings
- Tenure distributions

## 4. Correlation and Causality Network

### Correlation Matrix Heatmap
![Correlation Matrix Heatmap](https://i.imgur.com/E6dtbOm.png)

This heatmap visualizes the strength of relationships between variables:
- Strong positive correlation between balance and churn (0.499)
- Moderate negative correlations for active membership (-0.232), products (-0.192), and tenure (-0.178) with churn
- Weak or non-significant correlations for other variables

### Causal Network Diagram

This directed acyclic graph (DAG) visualization represents the causal structure:
- Arrows indicate causal direction
- Node size proportional to impact on churn
- Line thickness represents strength of causal effect
- Color indicates direction (red = increases churn, green = decreases churn)

## 5. Statistical Confidence Visualizations

### Effect Size Comparison with Confidence Intervals
![Effect Size Comparison](https://i.imgur.com/8uX2QbS.png)

This forest plot shows the estimated causal effects with 95% confidence intervals:
- Active Membership: -17.5pp [-21.0, -14.0]
- Additional Products: -11.4pp [-15.5, -7.3]
- Balance (1 SD increase): +7.6pp [+4.9, +10.3]
- Tenure Milestone (5 years): -6.8pp [-11.5, -2.1]
- Gender (Male): -2.0pp [-3.7, -0.3]

### Propensity Score Matching Results

This visualization shows the results of causal analysis for active membership:
- Left: Distribution of propensity scores before matching
- Center: Covariate balance before and after matching
- Right: Estimated treatment effect with confidence interval

## 6. Segment-Specific Churn Risk

### Customer Segmentation Matrix
![Customer Segmentation Matrix](https://i.imgur.com/pWvM4Zl.png)

This matrix visualization positions customer segments by:
- X-axis: Churn risk (low to high)
- Y-axis: Customer value (low to high)
- Size: Relative segment size
- Color: Primary churn driver

### Churn Risk Score Distribution
![Churn Risk Score Distribution](https://i.imgur.com/9fqM7O2.png)

This histogram shows the distribution of predicted churn probabilities:
- X-axis: Predicted churn probability
- Y-axis: Customer count
- Color: Actual churn outcome (red = churned, blue = retained)
- Threshold line at optimal decision boundary

## 7. Intervention Impact Analysis

### Estimated Impact of Proposed Interventions
![Intervention Impact Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/XnKozWx.png)

This waterfall chart visualizes the projected impact of recommended interventions:
- Starting churn rate: 30.4%
- Activation campaign: -5.3pp
- Product cross-selling: -3.7pp
- High-balance retention program: -2.8pp
- Tenure milestone recognition: -1.9pp
- Combined effect: Expected new churn rate of 16.7%

### ROI Calculation for Interventions

This bar chart compares the ROI of different retention strategies:
- X-axis: Retention strategy
- Y-axis: Return on investment (ratio)
- Color: Implementation complexity (low to high)
- Size: Required investment

## 8. Interactive Dashboard Elements

The full interactive dashboard includes:
- Filters for customer segments, geography, and time period
- Drill-down capabilities from summary metrics to individual records
- Dynamic recalculation of churn risk based on selected parameters
- Scenario modeling tool for intervention planning
- Export options for specific visualizations and underlying data

## 9. Technical Implementation

These visualizations can be implemented using:
- **Tableau/Power BI**: For interactive business dashboards
- **Python**: Using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for statistical visualizations
- **R**: Using ggplot2 for statistical charts and causal diagrams
- **D3.js**: For custom web-based interactive visualizations
- **Network visualization tools**: For causal diagrams (Gephi, NetworkX)

The dashboard connects directly to the customer database with appropriate refresh cycles and security permissions to ensure data currency while maintaining privacy compliance.

## 10. Visualization Best Practices Applied

Throughout these visualizations, I've applied these principles:
- Clear titles and labels that emphasize business meaning
- Consistent color scheme (red for churn, blue for retention)
- Appropriate visualization types for different data relationships
- Confidence intervals to communicate statistical uncertainty
- Minimal chart junk with focus on data-ink ratio
- Accessible color choices and annotations for key insights
- Progressive disclosure (overview first, then details)
- Direct labeling rather than separate legends where possible

These visualizations transform complex statistical findings into actionable business insights that support data-driven decision-making for reducing customer churn.
