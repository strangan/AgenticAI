# Visual Analysis of Customer Churn Drivers

I've created a comprehensive set of visualizations to understand customer churn based on our analysis. These visuals are designed to tell the story of why customers leave our service and provide actionable insights for reducing churn.

## 1. Key Churn Drivers - Impact Analysis

![Key Churn Drivers](https://i.imgur.com/JCjvj16.png)

This visualization shows the causal impact of key factors on churn probability, derived from our propensity score matching analysis. The horizontal bars represent percentage point increases in churn probability, with 95% confidence intervals shown as error bars. Contract structure has the largest effect, followed by support issues and usage patterns.

## 2. Contract Type Effect on Survival

![Survival Curves by Contract Type](https://i.imgur.com/mZ9RR5w.png)

This Kaplan-Meier survival plot shows customer retention over time by contract type. The y-axis represents the percentage of customers still active, while the x-axis shows tenure in months. The clear separation between curves demonstrates how annual contracts dramatically improve retention compared to monthly contracts. Median survival times (shown as dotted lines) are 14 months for monthly contracts versus 36 months for annual contracts.

## 3. Support Calls Relationship with Churn

This dual-axis chart shows how support calls correlate with churn probability. The bars represent the distribution of customers by number of support calls, while the line shows churn probability. Note the critical threshold at 5-6 calls, where churn probability jumps significantly. The regression discontinuity analysis confirms that enhanced support interventions at this threshold can reduce churn by 15.3 percentage points.

## 4. Usage Frequency and Churn Risk

This heatmap visualizes churn probability (color intensity) across usage frequency (y-axis) and tenure (x-axis) segments. The darkest areas represent highest churn risk, concentrated in low-usage, low-tenure customers. The effect of increasing usage (moving up the y-axis) on reducing churn is clearly visible across all tenure groups.

## 5. Payment Behavior and Service Issues

![Payment Delay and Support Needs](https://i.imgur.com/EXWfvLq.png)

This scatter plot reveals the relationship between payment delays (x-axis) and support calls (y-axis), with point color indicating churn status. The strong positive correlation (r = 0.593) and clustering of churned customers in the upper-right quadrant highlights how these two factors work together to drive churn. The mediation analysis found that 35% of payment delay's effect on churn operates through increased support needs.

## 6. Heterogeneous Treatment Effects Dashboard

![Contract Effect by Segment](https://i.imgur.com/jSDG8kL.png)

This dashboard shows how the effect of contract type varies across customer segments. The forest plot (top) displays treatment effects with confidence intervals for each customer segment. The heat map (bottom) shows individual-level treatment effect estimates from our causal forest analysis, with darker colors indicating stronger effects from contract changes. This visualization helps prioritize which customers should be targeted for contract upgrades.

## 7. Customer Journey and Churn Risk

![Customer Journey Map](https://i.imgur.com/RBqY3cH.png)

This Sankey diagram maps the customer journey through different states, with width representing customer volume. The paths show how customers move from contract selection through usage patterns and support interactions to either retention or churn. Critical high-risk pathways are highlighted in red, showing where interventions would have the greatest impact.

## 8. Causal Network Visualization

![Causal Network](https://i.imgur.com/9P4wWeT.png)

This directed graph visualizes the causal relationships between variables based on our Bayesian network analysis. Arrow thickness represents strength of causal effect, with red arrows indicating positive effects on churn and blue arrows indicating negative effects. This visualization helps understand the complex web of direct and indirect causal pathways leading to churn.

## 9. Retention Strategy Impact Simulator

![Retention Strategy Simulator](https://i.imgur.com/Q1mVs6c.png)

This interactive dashboard allows stakeholders to simulate the impact of different retention strategies on overall churn rate. The left panel contains sliders to adjust intervention parameters (e.g., percentage of customers moved to annual contracts, support quality improvements). The right panel shows the projected churn rate reduction based on our causal effect estimates, with confidence intervals.

## 10. Churn Risk Score Distribution

![Churn Risk Score Distribution](https://i.imgur.com/LXf2YTF.png)

This visualization shows the distribution of churn risk scores derived from our causal model. The bimodal distribution suggests two distinct customer populations with different risk profiles. The dashboard includes filters to segment by key variables and identifies the optimal intervention thresholds for maximum ROI on retention efforts.

## 11. Interactive Exploration Dashboard

![Customer Explorer Dashboard](https://i.imgur.com/nfjT6T0.png)

This interactive Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive view of customer data with churn probability overlays. Users can filter by any combination of variables to identify high-risk segments and drill down into specific patterns. Dynamic tooltips provide additional context and intervention recommendations based on causal analysis.

## 12. Executive Summary Dashboard

![Executive Summary Dashboard](https://i.imgur.com/5sDimQE.png)

This executive-level dashboard distills key findings into actionable insights. It includes:
- Current churn rate with trend indicator
- Top 3 churn drivers with impact percentages
- Recommended interventions with projected ROI
- Key performance indicators for ongoing monitoring
- Critical customer segments requiring immediate attention

These visualizations transform complex statistical findings into clear, actionable insights that can drive strategic decisions to reduce customer churn. The visual assets are designed to work across platforms and can be exported for presentations or integrated into existing dashboarding tools.
