    Process the CSV File. Inspect the data and provide a summary including:
    - The column names	
    - Any missing values
    - Basic insights such as potential predictors of churn
    - Any anomalies, duplicates, or notable distributions
    
    Answer the following questions as well
    
    1. Were you able to locate the file?
    2. What are the main patterns in the data?
    2. What insights can you provide about customer behavior?
    3. Are there any anomalies or interesting trends?

    Use the 'CSVSearchTool' to process the file and search for relevant information.

    You may choose to sample upto 10000 rows of data if the file is too long but ensure 
    it is a stratified sample to ensure each subgroup (strata) of a population is 
    adequately represented in the sample, improving the precision of estimates and 
    reducing sampling variability.
